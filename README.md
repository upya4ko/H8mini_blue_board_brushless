### H8mini Blue board version###

# WORK IN PROGRESS
I try convert H8 board to brushless FC using cheep 1S ESC from AliExpress
First working example done, need test before publish

Warning: new blue board version is not compatible with this firmware as it uses an obscure PAN163CX microcontroller with integrated XN297L. To distinguish it from the supported version look through the battery bay to determine the antenna pin location. On older boards it was on the side, on the newer it's centered, see https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=40328262&postcount=14761 .

> Hi all, I finally got the h8mini blue board erased and flashed to Silverxxx firmware after zillion times of tried and error.
> The board's labelled wrong with the CLK and DAT got swapped....
> 
> This is how I got it work from the STLINK to the H8mini blue board:
> SWDIO->CLK
> GND->GND
> SWCLK->DAT
> 
> Thanks Silverxxx for this wonderful firmware! Cheers!

> The st-link starts working after it is used in some other way , such as: flash another quad with keil(not blue board) , use > the "st-link utility" and connect to a board(even blue), use openocd and connect to a board (even blue).

> Another find was that the nucleo built in st-link does not have this issue. It also does not get detected by the st-link firmware updater. A nucleo board is about $12

_The last 2 posts refer to windows and keil only_

This port supports both acro only and dual mode. To enable acro only, an option exist in config.h.

The H8 board - blue version - uses a stm32f030 and a XN297L 3 wire radio. The XN297L is differerent from the XN297 in that is supports 250K rate, and the debug registers are different.
